# House-Price-Prediction-using-DNN-Keras

Here, in this we use Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to predict house prices. 
                  
          NOTE:: To improve accuracy of the model we have used DNN.

Installations:

      Python 3.6
Packages to be installed:

          pip install numpy
          pip install pandas
          pip install matplotlib
For python 3.6, to install keras first we have to install tensorflow. Make sure to install tensorflow before installing keras.

           pip install tensorflow==2.0.0
           and then,
           pip install keras==2.2.4
NOTE: If u encountered problems like this,

       TensorFlow 2.1 import 'DLL load failed error' #36665 Closed
       DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found. #36683 Closed
       ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found. #36702
Make sure to install these,

       1. Go to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads
       2. Then download x64: vc_redist.x64.exe
       3. And install it.
It works.

Okay!!! These are the installations we require to start this project. Hope this helps you guys.
